Algorithms:
    * Policy gradient:
        - Natural gradient
        - NES
    * Value-based:
        - dueling DQN

Various:
    * Fix get_value() in Parameters such that an exception is raised when the parameter value is returned as slice
    * Remove print functions in deep_actor_critic

For Mushroom 1.6:
    * drop support of ActionRegressor, simplify Regressor interface
    * vectorize basis functions and simplify interface
    * improvements to documentation and tutorials
    * extend support of MushroomRL classes to Serializable interface
        - Fix RQ-Learning: delta and beta are optionally None and this may break the save.
          Right now, using pickle to store the parameters
        - maybe improve the mushroom save when the value is None?
    * fix use of Parameters

For Mushroom 2.0:
    * support multi-objective RL
